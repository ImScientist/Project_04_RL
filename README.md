# Project_04_RL
some tests with reinforcement learning.

RL_01 applies a gradient ascend method to maximize the value function (V). The boundary condition that the sum
of all jump probabilities has to be equal to one is implemented with an additional penalty term.
The strength of the penalty coefficient for the boundary condition increases slowly until the boundary condition is satisfied to a certain extend.
